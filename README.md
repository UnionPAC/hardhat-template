# Hey ğŸ‘‹ I'm a new hardhat template!

I work with hardhat a lot. This is my preferred starting point when working on a project. I created this basic template
to save me some time so I don't have to set things up from scratch every time! 

If you'd like to use it go right ahead! It's pretty plug & play ğŸ™‚
